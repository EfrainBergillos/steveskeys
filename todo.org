* TODO In btree get rid of add-val, handle that externally?
* TODO In fs I need to change the byte sizes to handle saving two root nodes.


* DONE Save root node pointer in the tree so we can use it in the commit
* DONE Implement some methods to serialize tree leafs and nodes
* TODO Store the values in a seperate btree so there are no duplicates
* TODO Use two different agent wrapped file accessors so writes and reads don't block eachother. Use promises to get the return values.
* TODO make the sequence that traverse returns lazier
* TODO clean up the rough parts, do some refactoring of the btree code to make it look nicer
* TODO publish first release to clojars
